## About Me

In 2012, I graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University with two bachelor
degrees in 1) Mathematics and 2) Computer Science. In 2021, I completed my MBA from Temple University in Philadelphia.

I have been a professional technologist since 2011, holding roles from researcher to full stack developer.
Most recently, I managed two agile teams in the D&A department, one searching for insights to curve the opioid epidemic.

At time of writing, I am a based out of New Zealand, but have worked in the USA, UK, and Hong Kong. 

I'm passionate about applying technology when and where it makes an impact. I try to write code that is easy to use, read, and maintain.
I never feel like I know enough, so I am always experimenting/tinkering/playing with something.

Away from the laptop, I am probably cooking, making a complicated tiki cocktail, or (if I publish this, I need to commit) at the gym.
