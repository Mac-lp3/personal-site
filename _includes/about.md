## About Me

In 2012, I graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University with two bachelor
degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am currently working on my MBA at Temple University in Philadelphia.

I have been a professional technologist since 2011, from a memeber of a graduate research team to full stack developer. At the moment, I manage two teams of engineers and data scientists, with one searching for insights to curve the opioid epedemic.

I am based out of Philadelphia, but spent two years working in Europe and Asia, where I used technology to solve business problems or just make everyone's job a bit easier.

I'm passionate about open source technology and like to write software that is easy to use, read, maintain, and makes an impact.

Outside of work, you can find me in a cafe learning a programming language or framework, at the gym, or on vacation chasing new passport stamps.
