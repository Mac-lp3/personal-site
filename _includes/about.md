## About Me

In 2012, I graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University with two bachelor
degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am currently working on my MBA at Temple University in Philadelphia.

I have been a (professional) technologist of various forms since 2011, from graduate researcher to full stack developer. At the moment, I am technical lead for a medium sized team of developers.

I am based out of Philadelphia, but spent two years working in Europe and Asia, using technology to solve business problems (or make somone's job a bit easier).

I'm passionate about open source technology and like to write software that is easy to use, maintain, and makes and impact.

Outside of work, you can find me in a cafe learning a programming language or framework, at the gym, or on vacation chasing new passport stamps.
