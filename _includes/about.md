## About Me

Michael graduated from Eastern Connecticut State University in 2012 with bachelor
degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. He is currently working on his MBA at Temple University in Philadelphia.

He has been a technologist of varying forms since 2011, from researcher to full stack developer.

He currently resides in Philadelphia, but spent two years working in Europe and Asia, where he used the latest technology to solve business problems (or just make the job a little easier).

He is passionate about open source technology and tries to write software that is easy to use, maintain, and improves the lives of others.

Outside of work, you can find him learning a programming language or framework, at the gym, working with a local tech group, or on vacation in a new country.
